# Sprint Change Proposal: "Soulful" Renaming & Portfolio Narrative

**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Status:** Draft
**Trigger:** User feedback requesting "Artsy/Soulful" page names, custom fonts for headers, and a dedicated "Memories of Sora" portfolio section.

## 1. Identified Issue
While the visual theme is now "Spirit World," the nomenclature ("Film Explorer", "Methodology") remains clinical and generic. The portfolio lacks a narrative explanation for the major pivot away from the "Sora" AI agent (Epic 4).

## 2. Recommended Path Forward
**"Poetic Naming" & Narrative Expansion.**
We will rename all functional sections to evocative, "artsy" titles that align with the Spirit World aesthetic. We will also add a dedicated page to tell the story of the deprecated AI agent, turning a "failed" epic into a strong portfolio narrative about product decision-making.

## 3. Artifact Adjustments

### Story 5.1: Streamlit App Structure (Refactor v2)
*   **Action:** Update `Home.py` and `pages/` filenames to reflect new naming convention.
*   **New Navigation:**
    *   *Film Explorer* -> **The Spirit Archives** (`1_The_Spirit_Archives.py`)
    *   *Director Profiles* -> **Architects of Emotion** (`2_Architects_of_Emotion.py`)
    *   *Translation Insights* -> **Echoes Across Languages** (`3_Echoes_Across_Languages.py`)
    *   *Methodology* -> **The Alchemy of Data** (`4_The_Alchemy_of_Data.py`)
    *   *New Page* -> **Memories of Sora** (`5_Memories_of_Sora.py`)

### Epic 5 Structure (Renamed Stories)
*   **Story 5.3:** "The Spirit Archives" (Film Visualization)
*   **Story 5.4:** "Architects of Emotion" (Director Profiles)
*   **Story 5.5:** "Echoes Across Languages" (Translation Analysis)
*   **Story 5.6:** "The Alchemy of Data" (Methodology & Disclaimer)
*   **Story 5.8 (NEW):** "Memories of Sora" (Portfolio Narrative)

### Content Requirements
*   **About Section:** Add specific disclaimer about subtitle versions.
*   **Memories of Sora:** Document the "Quest," "Reality," and "Pivot" of the AI agent.
*   **Visuals:** Use custom fonts (Cinzel) for all section headers (Sidebar & Main).

## 4. Action Plan
1.  **Approve Proposal.**
2.  **Quick Refactor Story 5.1:** Rename files and update Home page links.
3.  **Update Epic 5:** Rename all pending stories in the backlog.

## 5. Success Criteria
*   Navigation feels like a "Journey," not a "Dashboard."
*   "Memories of Sora" exists as a page.
*   Subtitle disclaimer is present.
